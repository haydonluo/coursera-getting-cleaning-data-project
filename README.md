# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) where the data was obtained.
The following files are included in this repo:
* `codeBook.md` describes the variables and transformations performed to clean up the data.
* `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the cleaning and transformation. 
 
The final output is uploaded into Coursera platform as `calculated_tidy_data.txt`.
